/**
 * Problem Statement: Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values.
 * (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
 *
 * Approach:
 * We can solve this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS). We will traverse the tree level by level.
 * We will use a queue to store the nodes at each level. We will also maintain a boolean variable to
 * keep track of the direction of traversal for the current level (left to right or right to left).
 * For each level, we will process all the nodes in the queue and store their values in a temporary list.
 * If the traversal direction for the current level is right to left, we will reverse the temporary list before adding it to the result.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(W), where W is the maximum width of the binary tree, as the queue can hold at most W nodes at any level. In the worst case (a complete binary tree), W can be up to N/2.
 *
 * Optimal Solution: The approach described above is already optimal in terms of time and space complexity for this problem.
