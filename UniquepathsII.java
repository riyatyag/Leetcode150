// Problem Statement:
// You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle. Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner. The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

// Approach:
// Dynamic Programming.  Create a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of unique paths to reach cell (i, j).

// Time Complexity:
// O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

// Space Complexity:
// O(m * n) for the dp array.

// Optimal Solution:

class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1 || obstacleGrid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1)
            return 0;

        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 && dp[i - 1][0] == 1) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = (obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0 && dp[0][j - 1] == 1) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
